"""
This module contains the prompt templates and configurations for LangChain.

Prompt templates are used to structure the input for language models in a
consistent and reusable way. This module may include various prompt templates
for different tasks such as question answering, text generation, or any other
specific use cases in the application.

As the application's use of LangChain grows, this module can be expanded to
include more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques and utility functions
for managing and customizing prompts.
