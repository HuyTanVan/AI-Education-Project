"""
This module serves as the initialization point for the utils package.

The utils package contains various utility functions and helper modules
that are used across the application. These utilities may include common
operations, data processing functions, or any other reusable code that
doesn't fit into more specific modules.

As the application grows, this package can be expanded to include more
utility functions and submodules to support various parts of the codebase.
