"""
This module contains the implementation of LangChain chains for the application.

LangChain chains are sequences of calls to language models or other utilities
that can be used to accomplish specific tasks. This module may include various
chain implementations tailored to the application's needs, such as question
answering, text summarization, or custom workflows.

As the application's use of LangChain expands, this module can be extended
to include more sophisticated chain implementations and utility functions
to support complex language model-based operations.
